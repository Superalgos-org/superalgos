## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are a community-driven project and value the security community's efforts to improve our security.

To report a security vulnerability, please send an email to **security@superalgos.org** with a detailed description of the issue. Please do not create a public GitHub issue.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following details:

*   A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
*   The steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   Any relevant screenshots, code snippets, or other information that can help us understand and fix the issue.

### What to Expect

After you report a vulnerability, we will do our best to:

1.  Acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days.
2.  Provide you with an estimated timeline for addressing the vulnerability.
3.  Notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed.

We ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to release a patch.

## Security-Conscious Design

Superalgos is designed with security in mind. Here are some of the key principles that guide our development:

*   **Local First:** Superalgos runs on your machine. Your API keys, strategies, and other sensitive data never leave your computer.
*   **Trustless:** You do not need to trust any third-party service with your funds or API keys. The software connects directly to your exchange.
*   **Open Source:** The entire codebase is open source and available for review by the community. This transparency helps us identify and fix security issues quickly.

We encourage all users to follow best practices for securing their trading setup, such as:

*   Using a dedicated sub-account for trading.
*   Granting only the necessary permissions to your API keys (e.g., no withdrawal rights).
*   Keeping your Superalgos installation up-to-date.

Thank you for helping keep Superalgos and our community safe.
